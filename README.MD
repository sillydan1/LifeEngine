# LIFE ENGINE V3
#### The plan
Life Engine is a work in progress game engine that aims to be as multithreaded as possible. 
The engine is coded in C++ with support for OpenGL, Vulkan and DirectX 11 & 12. 
Users of the engine can script game-code in C# through the CLR 
module.

#### The progress
V3 is a complete rewrite. There are some features implemented in V1 and V2, but the architectures of those versions were so
terrible that a complete rewrite had to be done.
